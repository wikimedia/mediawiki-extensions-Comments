To get relevant and distinct error messages, the method implementing all this logic could return a StatusValue object, which allows setting a message object and params for fatal errors.",

This was definitely worth doing as the logic has already diverged.\n\nAlso there\u0027s a minor change because of this, you are no longer allowed to post empty comments, because that check applies to both.",
