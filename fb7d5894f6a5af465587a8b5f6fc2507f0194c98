      "message": "PS9(/PS10) is a manual rebase with some small tweaks\n* Tiny grammar tweak in en.json\n* Version bump in extension.json\n* $user-\u003eisBlocked() changed to $user-\u003egetBlock() in the new CommentEditAPI.php file, as per a recently merged patch ()\n* Documentation additions, in includes/Comment.php, resources/js/Comment.js and resources/css/Comments.css\n* Commented out an unused variable in includes/Comment.php\n* Swapped double quotes to single in Comment#showComment\n\nThis theoretically merges now just fine, but I\u0027d still like to test it further and maybe tweak the UI a bit.\nRight now there is no history UI of any kind, which is understandable from a developer POV because we issue an UPDATE query against the text in the DB, so the previous text literally gets overwritten. This may not be desireable, however, from a community aspect, because though comment edits are logged, the log only displays the brand new comment text; the old one may partially be there but this feature *can* allow \"dirty editing\" of comments, thus I\u0027d like to introduce the following things before merging this:\n1) a (tiny) visual indicator of somesuch in the comment HTML block indicating that text has been changed since the initial submission; probably just sticking \u003csmall\u003e(edited)\u003c/small\u003e somewhere will do just fine\n2) a brand new comment-edit or comment-edit-own user right, akin to the existing comment-delete-own user right, given to no group by default but available for users wishing to make use of this feature",
