(As per https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Social_tools/MediaWiki_compatibility Comments, together with other social tools extensions, targets LTS compatibility firstly and foremostly; forwards-compatibility with newer MWs using if-else loops is *totally* fine and very much welcome, as long as LTS compat isn\u0027t broken!)",
